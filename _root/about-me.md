My name is **Aman King**. I am a Software Development Manager at [Atlassian][], having joined in 2015. My earlier work experience includes 8 years at [ThoughtWorks][] as Lead Consultant, and 2 years at [GlobalLogic][] as Associate - Engineering.

I have been specializing in the **Agile software development** space since 2006. I have delivered multiple projects from diverse domains. All of these were with Agile teams using XP practices, such as TDD and Pair Programming. The teams were either co-located, distributed, or offshore. The projects were typically web applications or web services, often using **Java technologies** or **Ruby on Rails**. The applications were either hosted traditionally or deployed on the Amazon cloud.

I have also worked as an **Agile Coach**. I have coached teams with sizes ranging from 7 to 30.

In addition to playing roles of Application Developer, Tech Lead, and Agile Coach, I have spent time conducting trainings, speaking at conferences, writing on technical topics, and working on **open source software**.

My personal interests lie in code design, especially as influenced by OOP, TDD, and Refactoring. I wrote about this topic in a **book** published by the Pragmatic Programmers, [The ThoughtWorks Anthology, Volume 2][].

Of late, I enjoy exploring motivations that drive improvement in individuals and teams.

In Atlassian, I work on the Identity &amp; Access Management systems that power Atlassian Cloud products. My responsibilies include delivery of cross-department projects, internal stakeholder management, technical guidance across multiple systems, and mentorship to Team Leads.
