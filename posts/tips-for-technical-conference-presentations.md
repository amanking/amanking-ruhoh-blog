Googling for "[tips for presentations][]" will give you a lot of useful links. I want to capture here some basic tips, specifically for technical conferences. Not much about beautiful slides but about readable ones. As an audience, I find it unfair when a talk is really good but the slides are unreadable!

#### Logistics
* *Find out about the resolution* supported by the projector at the conference venue. Set your machine's resolution to the same and check your presentation. At times you'll find your text word-wrapped in weird ways or your pictures going outside the screen boundary.
* *Do not rely on wifi.* Most conference venues arrange for wifi but they are almost always flaky. Avoid running your slides off prezi.com directly. Avoid embedding YouTube streaming videos. Avoid a demo that needs an Internet connection. Keep things local.

#### Text & Colours
* *Do not use low contrast colours.* Especially between the slide background and the text. Audiences at any distance, close or far, will have difficulty reading your slides if you choose an Emacs-style scheme. I typically prefer a simple white background and black text, with some red or blue thrown in for effect.
* *Use less text. But large font size.* Keeps the audience focused on you. But also makes your slide readable from a distance. Having no text is better than having unreadable text.
* *Avoid complex diagrams.* Have labels in a large font. The audience should be able to comprehend the diagram quickly and without hurting their eyes.
* *Use safe colours for text and diagrams.* Basically common primary colours that have a good chance of being projected correctly. Some colours on your monitor look very different on a projected screen. Subtle colour variations get lost when projected, so do not rely on those.
* *Avoid placing text or images towards the bottom of the screen.* Most conferences have multiple tracks. This translates to small rooms cramped with a lot of chairs. The bottom of the screen is hidden from those sitting even a few rows behind.

#### Code snippets
* *Adjust your editor's look and feel* before taking a screenshot of code snippets. Choose a white background with dark text, and make the font size large.
* *Have the code snippets ready on your machine* in case the screenshots do not appear clearly. During the presentation, you could switch to your editor to show the code. Keep the editor in an easy-to-view colour scheme with a large font.
* *Annotate code snippets* where applicable. Helps the audience follow the parts you want to talk about.

Final advice: **do a trial run,** ideally at the venue itself, and get feedback.
