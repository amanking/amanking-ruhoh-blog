My name is **Aman King**. I am a Software Development Manager at [Atlassian][], having joined in 2015. My prior work experience includes 8 years at [ThoughtWorks][] as Lead Consultant, and 2 years at [GlobalLogic][] as Associate - Engineering. I have been specializing in **Agile software development** since 2006.

At Atlassian, I work on the Identity &amp; Access Management systems that power Atlassian **cloud products**. These involve **distributed microservices** with high availability and scaling requirements. The services provide seamless cross-product experiences for end users and product administrators.  In addition to delivery of cross-department projects, my responsibilities include stakeholder management, technical guidance across multiple systems, and mentorship to engineering teams leads.

As part of ThoughtWorks, I had delivered multiple projects for clients from diverse business domains. All of these were with Agile teams using XP practices, such as TDD and Pair Programming. The teams were either co-located, distributed, or offshore. The projects were typically web applications or web services, often using **Java technologies** or **Ruby on Rails**. The applications were either hosted traditionally or deployed on the Amazon cloud. I also worked as an **Agile Coach** for clients, having coached teams with sizes ranging from 7 to 30 people. I also spent time conducting trainings, speaking at conferences, writing on technical topics, and working on **open source software**.

My personal interests lie in code design, especially as influenced by OOP, TDD, and Refactoring. I wrote about this topic in a **book** published by the Pragmatic Programmers: [The ThoughtWorks Anthology, Volume 2][].

Of late, I enjoy exploring motivations that drive improvement in individuals and teams.
