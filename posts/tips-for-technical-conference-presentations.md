Googling for "[tips for presentations][]" will give you a lot of useful links. I want to capture here some basic tips, specifically for technical conferences. Not much about beautiful slides but about readable ones. As an audience, I find it unfair when a talk is really good but the slides are unreadable!

#### Resolution
* *Find out about the resolution* supported by the projector at the conference venue. Set your machine's resolution to the same and check your presentation. At times you'll find your text word-wrapped in weird ways or your pictures going outside the screen boundary

#### Font & Colours
* *Do not use low contrast colours.* Especially between the slide background and the text. Audiences at any distance, close or far, will have difficulty reading your slides if you choose an Emacs-style scheme. I typically prefer a simple white background and black text, with some red or blue thrown in for effect.
* *Use less text with large font size.* Not just to keep the audience focused on you. But also to make your slide actually readable from a distance. Text in small font is worse than no text at all.
* *Avoid complex diagrams* with many components. Labels should be in large fonts. The audience should be able to comprehend the diagram quickly and without hurting their eyes.
* *Use safe colours for text and diagrams.* Basically distinct shades that have a good chance of being projected correctly. Some colours on your monitor could look completely different on a projected screen. Subtle colour variations also get lost when projected, so do not rely on those.

#### Code snippets
* For code snippets, *adjust your editor's look and feel* before taking a screenshot. Choose a white background with dark text, and make the font size large.
* *Have the code snippets ready on your machine* in case the screenshots do not appear clearly. You could then switch to your editor to show the code better. Also, keep the editor already in an easy-to-view colour scheme with a large font.
* *Annotate diagrams or code snippets* where applicable. Helps the audience follow the parts you want to talk about.

Final advice: **do a trial run,** ideally at the venue itself, and get feedback.
