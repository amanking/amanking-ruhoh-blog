Had the opportunity to attend and speak at the first Bangalore-based Ruby conference, [Garden City RubyConf 2014][]. It was reminiscent of the first [RubyConf India in 2010][], where I also spoke incidentally.

Among the conferences I've attended recently, this was definitely among the better ones. Great job by the organizers to line up some [interesting talks][], including keynotes.

I got to meet [Chad Fowler][] after many years. In 2007, he was one of my trainers in an [Advanced Ruby on Rails workshop][] I had attended in Dallas, US. In fact, I showed him a copy of [My Job Went to India][] that he'd signed for me back then. Chad's keynote was quite thought-provoking. He challenged many existing notions about developing and deploying software, and encouraged looking at some refreshingly new approaches out there.

Besides Chad, other speakers were good too. I also noticed something curiously common among the speakers: most were ex-ThoughtWorkers. The conference allowed me to catch up with my ex-colleagues, and hear them share experiences on and off stage. In fact, the conference allowed ample time to network with new and old friends. I later learnt the number of breaks and their durations were consciously planned by the organizers to allow networking. Definitely a good move!

I made a lot of new acquaintances. My talk helped, as many reached out to me to share their appreciation, and to learn about my experiences with DSLs. I was pleasantly surprised that some of the attendees remembered my [RubyConf India 2010 talk][] as well!

My talk this time was about implementing simple Ruby DSL techniques to improve productivity in business application development. My slides are embeded below.

All in all, two days very well-spent! I will definitely recommend this conference to all Ruby developers out there!
