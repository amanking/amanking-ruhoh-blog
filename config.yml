# This helps parsers (and hosting platforms) determine which version is needed to compile your site.
# If you compile your blog yourself, setting this won't matter, but it's a nice thing to keep updated.
RuhohSpec: "2.2"

# Used for things like RSS that need the full URL to a given resource.
# This DOES NOT affect any of your paths or links in any way.
# This DOES NOT configure domain mapping. See post2.ruhoh.com for hosting options.
production_url: "http://www.amanking.com"

# Intelligently prepends all urls in the system with the given base_path.
# This allows you to host your blog in a subdirectory of a given website.
# Example:
#  To host at the path: http://myuniversity.edu/staff/me/~/blog.
#  set base_path: "/staff/me/~/blog"
# NOTE: base_path is never added in development mode (for convenience).
