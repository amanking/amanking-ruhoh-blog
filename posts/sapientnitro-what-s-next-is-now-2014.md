The invitation to [SapientNitro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sapientnitro)'s 1-day conference was extended to me by someone with whom I had worked closely on a client-side consulting engagement. It was difficult to refuse, especially since the session topics seemed so interesting.

The speakers were senior SapientNitro technologists who had recently completed a year-long [executive development programme](http://sapientnitroblog.com/post/92035552475). The attendees were mostly architects and senior technologists at SapientNitro.

I must admit that the quality of all the speakers' presentations was top-notch, including both visuals and content. There was also an impressive consistency across everyone's slides that made the sessions through the day seamless.

Some of the topics I enjoyed included:

* Personalized Recommendations
* Physical Computing
* Modern Customer Loyalty
* Ad Space Evolution
* Presentation Design

Because of parallel tracks, I had to miss other topics like Big Data, Content Marketing, Social Intelligence, and more.

I enjoyed all the sessions I attended, and had at least one question for every speaker. By the end of the day, everyone knew me as the person with a lot of questions. I was the only one representing [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) there. I got to interact with multiple SapientNitro employees, old acquaintances and new, including their leadership team. They left a positive impression on me, and overall, it was a day well-spent. I am glad I attended.
