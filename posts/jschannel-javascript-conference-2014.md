Douglas. Crockford.

Need I say more?

Possibly the most esteemed name in JavaScript, the person who gave us JSON, and all those [JS lecture videos](http://yuiblog.com/crockford/), and of course, the [book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb) that helped thousands gain a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language.

**[Douglas Crockford][]** gave the opening keynote. He talked about the good parts of the latest work being done on [JavaScript evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and some parts that he did not like. He believes JavaScript continues to suffer because it tries to accommodate beginners while reality is that most of its users are not beginners. He also introduced [Dec64](https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64) as a good option for a number data type. Douglas revisited [JSON](http://json.org/) in the current context of communication protocols. Most useful of all, was his advise to developers using JavaScript, which could be summed up succinctly as *"Don't make bugs".*

Douglas was followed by **[Sunil Pai][]** from Myntra. Dressed in casual clothing, with harmless sarcastic wit, and a great sense of humour, Sunil had an effective way of presenting. He came off as relatable, passionate, and as someone who enjoys doing what he does. There is definitely some interesting work going on in Myntra, involving [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), re-architecting, and building a scalable product.

Fellow ThoughtWorker, **[Suchit Puri][],** presented some of his team's learnings involving [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/). By the look of it, the framework seems opinionated, inspired from Rails, and solves multiple use cases in the client-side MVC domain.

Out of the two parallel workshop tracks, I attended **[Kapil Manchanda][]**'s HTML5 Game Programming workshop. It was fun seeing a simple but fun game getting built from scratch, using [phaser.io](http://phaser.io/). I definitely got some starting insights. Perhaps I'll be able to take time off to build a game of my own.

Day 1 wrapped up with some lightning talks, and networking over tea. Besides a few new acquaintances, I caught up with multiple ThoughtWorkers and ex-ThoughtWorkers, and some people from a previous client-side assignment.

All in all, [JSChannel](http://www.jschannel.com/) continues to be a good conference, worth attending. I would have loved to attend Day 2 but had to attend a [SapientNitro conference](sapientnitro-what-s-next-is-now-2014).
