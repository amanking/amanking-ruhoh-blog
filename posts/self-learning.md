A good degree of *self-learning* is expected out of every individual being coached during an [Agile Adoption][]. Without it, individuals cannot move through the various stages of learning as put across by the [Dreyfus Model][]. An Agile Coach may pair on tasks with individuals but such an approach is limited by team size, and one-on-one attention cannot be given for extended durations of time. After all, the way an Agile Coach operates is different from that of a Personal Trainer.

An Agile Coach will usually focus on providing the building blocks, and then set the individual on the path of self-learning. This is the approach right from the onset, where instead of spoon-feeding answers, the coach will use effective questioning to guide the individual to come up with their own reasonable conclusions. This is an application of what is widely known as [Socratic Method][].

Additionally what I follow is the [Princeton Model][] of learning:

* *70%* of the skills adoption comes from real work done on the ground. I pair with individuals on actual project work, and have coached individuals pair with others.
* *20%* of the skills adoption happens via workshops, sessions, and demos. These workshops are conducted by me or other invited experts. Demos and knowledge-sharing brown bag sessions are conducted on a regular basis within the team, where team members themselves volunteer to show-and-tell.
* *10%* of skills exposure happens via reading. Links to relevant articles and blogs are shared via mailing lists or wiki pages. Book recommendations are also made, and possibly added to a library.

What I have also seen encourage self-learning in teams is to throw challenges at them, and see them cope with it by upgrading their skill levels.

If an individual is dealing with challenges which are underwhelming, and do not require full utilization of existing skills, the individual gets bored or complacent. If, however, the individual is put up with overwhelming challenges, the individual will experience some frustration or stress, and will either try to reduce the challenges or will learn skills appropriate to overcome the challenges. If steered toward the latter behaviour, the person grows in competence.

These are some of the ways in which self-learning can take place in individuals and teams. They are effective tools to use during active coaching, to make a team reach levels of sustenance. This process may lead some individuals down the path to [self-discovery][].
