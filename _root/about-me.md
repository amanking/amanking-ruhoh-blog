My name is **Aman King**. I am a technologist at [ThoughtWorks][], working as Lead Consultant.
[ThoughtWorks]:http://www.thoughtworks.com

I have been in the **Agile** space since 2006. As an **Application Developer**, I have delivered multiple projects for clients from diverse domains. We work in Agile teams using XP practices, such as TDD and Pair Programming. We are either co-located, distributed, or offshore.

The projects are typically web applications or web services. We often use **Java technologies** or **Ruby on Rails**. The applications are hosted traditionally or deployed on the Amazon cloud.

I also work for clients as an **Agile Coach**. I have coached teams with sizes ranging from 7 to 30.

In addition to playing Tech Lead and Agile Coach, I spend time conducting trainings, speaking at conferences, writing on technical topics, and working on **open source software**.

My personal interests lie in code design, especially as influenced by OOP, TDD, and Refactoring. I wrote about this topic in a **book** published by the Pragmatic Programmers, [The ThoughtWorks Anthology, Volume 2][].

Of late, I also tend to explore the motivations that drive improvement in individuals and teams.
